This website uses a JSON database and serves as a note traker.  Using local storage works fine for people who don't use different machines and for saving non important information but using a database makes mush more sense. It helped me understand servers and creating my own APIs.

## Installation


To run this as a local server, clone the repo and open in your code editor.

If the folder contains the package.json with dependencies listed and/or package-lock.json file, simply enter 'npm install' in the terminal.
If none of those files are available or there aren't any dependencies listed in the package.json make sure to follow these steps:

1. type 'npm init' into the terminal
2. type 'npm package-name@version' for each package listed below:


-express@4.16.4

-generate-unique-id@2.0.1

Then start the server by running npm start in the terminal and go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Usage

Click on Get Started to get to the notes. The excisting notes will show up on the left and open on the right with it's description when clicked.

If the + button is clicked in top right corner it will let the user enter a note title and it's text.
